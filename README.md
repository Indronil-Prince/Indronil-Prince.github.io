**Game link: https://indronil-prince.github.io/game.html**


This version of "Dodge the Creeps" introduces several enhancements to the original game, aimed at 
providing a more dynamic and rewarding gameplay experience. With the addition of multiple lives, bonus 
lives, visual and audio feedback on being hit, players can enjoy a more engaging and slightly less punishing 
game.

**Modifications**

### 1) Multiple Lives ###

**• Lives Added:** Players now start the game with 3 lives instead of just 1. This change allows players 
more opportunities to score higher without restarting the game after a single hit.

**• Life Display:** Players start with 3 lives, displayed in a label at the top left corner of the screen, next 
to the score label. This allows players to easily keep track of their remaining chances.

### 2) Bonus Lives ###

**• Scoring System:** For every 10 points earned, players receive an extra life. This is designed to reward 
skill and longevity in the game.

**• Bonus Feedback:** Whenever a bonus life is awarded, a "Bonus +1" message flashes at the top 
middle of the screen for 1 second. This provides clear and immediate feedback that a bonus has 
been earned.

### 3) Visual and Audio Feedback on Hits ###

**• Hit Feedback:** Upon being hit by a creep, the player's character will flash red for 1 second, 
providing immediate visual feedback that a hit has occurred.

**• Sound Effect:** A collision sound effect plays when the player is hit, enhancing the feedback loop 
and helping players better understand the game's state without constantly watching the score or 
lives counter
